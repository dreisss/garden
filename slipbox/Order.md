> > Let $S$ be a [[Set]]. An order on S is a [[Relation]], denoted by $<$, with the following two properties:
> > 
> > 1. If $x\in S$ and Y E S then one and only one of the statements
> > $$x < y\text{, }x = y\text{, }y < x$$
> >  is true.
> >   
> > 2. If $x, y, z \in S$, if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$.
> >      
> > The statement "$x < y$" may be read as "x is *less than* y" or "x is *smaller* than y" or "x *precedes* y".
> > 
> > It is often convenient to write $y>x$ in place of $x < y$.
> > 
> > The notation $x\le y$ indicates that $x < y$ or $x = y$, without specifying which of these two is to hold. In other words, $x\le y$ is the negation of $x> y$.
