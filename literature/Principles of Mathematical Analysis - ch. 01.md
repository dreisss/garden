# The Real and Complex Number Systems

## Introduction

- We shall define the [[Real Numbers]] to have satisfactory studying of [[Real Analysis]].

> > A satisfactory discussion of the main concepts of analysis (such as convergence, continuity, differentiation, and integration) must be based on an accurately defined number concept

- The [[Rational Numbers]] is not sufficient to use concepts like [[Convergence]], [[Continuity]], [[Differentiation]] and [[Integration]].

This leads to the introduction of so-called "irrational numbers" which are often written as infinite decimal expansions and are considered to be "approximated" by the corresponding finite decimals. Thus the sequence

- [[The square root of 2 is irrational]] 
- [[The rational numbers set has gaps]]
