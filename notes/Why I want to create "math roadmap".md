Until my 1Â° year in high school, I was indifferent with math, I never had problems to learn neither was a genius to solve problems. I only studied what teacher passed and tried to pass the exams.

 Until [COVID-19 Pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), when I started to focus to pass in a greater university (motivated by my parents), [ITA](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica).

It's a university focused in engineering, and my parents wanted me to follow this career, but was in pure math that I found my passion.

Unfortunately I couldn't enter in ITA, i was not prepared. When I started studying by myself at home in pandemic I realised that my school teaching was precarious and not enough to me.

Today (26/06/2024, It has 4 year that I tried to enter in ITA. I graduated, in other course that I don't wanted, stopped studying math, entered in a job that is not what I like properly, my life moved on... But I never complied to not know things clearly, and with that intention that I want to study properly, all subjects I'm interested at.

That's why I created [[My math roadmap]]. And I pretend to create more and more, not only math, but physics, biology, chemistry, music, literature, photography, design and so on. 

[[My math roadmap]] is just the start!

Today I think:

> [!important]
> I love to learn!!! No matter what.

If interested, more detailed history will be put in [[My study history]].
