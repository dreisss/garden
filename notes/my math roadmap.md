This will be my personal guide and road map to study mathematics from zero. My goal is to construct basically all math from foundations to all that I can, achieving the modern mathematics studies.

All will be registered in the flow below:

![[my math roadmap.excalidraw]]

And all content will be referenced by book, articles, handwritten notes and more...

You'll can see all this material in the [[library]] page.

All my decisions will be registered in this garden, and you can understand my thoughts about my organisation.

You can start by: [[Why I want to create "math roadmap"]].
