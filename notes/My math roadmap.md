![[roadmap.gif|500]]

This will be my personal guide and road map to study mathematics from zero. My goal is to construct basically all math from foundations to all that I can, achieving the modern mathematics studies.

I plan to write this content based in some pillars:

1. All formally: Take care of each detail and argument, prove theorems, take axioms, etc.
2. "Go to the root": All will be constructed based in simple principles of each subject (e.g. set theory, logic, natural numbers ...)
3. Reference all: All content must be referenced, sometimes with one or many references (I like to read multiples perspectives).
4. Exercises all the time: some notes will be only to exercises to train some subject, and all must have solutions
5. Programming: I want to add, always possible, exercises related with programming, like simple scripts or algorithms.

All will be registered in the flow below:

![[my math roadmap.excalidraw]]

And all content will be referenced by book, articles, handwritten notes, other notes and more... Each subject will have an own road map by itself too.

You'll can see all this material in the [[library]] page.

All my decisions will be registered in this garden, and you can understand my thoughts about my organisation.

Starting from the start: [[Logic roadmap]]
